Sauce: a POSIX compliant shell script for updating and building packages.

About:
This script goes through a given directory of source builds (by default ~/.local/src), pulls any updates from git, and then runs make and sudo make clean install. Whenever sudo make clean install isn't available, 
it simply runs sudo cp (application_name) /usr/bin/  

Dependencies:
- GNU Make
- POSIX compliant shell (bash, zsh, etc.)
- git
